The Password Generator

The site creates a password based on the user's preferences.  First, the user is asked for a length of a desired password, from 8 to 128 characters. Then, prompts appear that ask the user whether or not to include lower or uppercase letters, special characters, or numbers. A password is created with the user's desired characters and length.

If the password length misses the parameters, the user is asked to enter a length between 8 and 128. The user must choose at least one type of password character or they will be prompted to begin the process again.

The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
